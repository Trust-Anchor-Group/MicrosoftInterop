Microsoft Interoperation
===========================

This repository contains services that help with interoperation with Microsoft products,
using **Open XML SDK** libraries. This SDK allows for interoperation with documents saved using
the Open XML specification, not old legacy formats (i.e. `.docx` works, `.doc` not so).
