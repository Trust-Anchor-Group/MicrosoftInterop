## Tables \& Notes

This example mixes footnotes[^fn1] and tables\.

### Table with large cells

| &nbsp; ||
|:---|:---|
| [^n1] | [^n2] |
| [^n3] | [^n4] |

The purpose is to see if footnotes[^fn2] and tables with complex cells interfere with each other\.


[^n1]:	First cell, first row
	
	First cell, second row
	
	First cell, third row

[^n2]:	Second cell, first row
	
	Second cell, second row
	
	Second cell, third row

[^n3]:	Third cell, first row
	
	Third cell, second row
	
	Third cell, third row

[^n4]:	Fourth cell, first row
	
	Fourth cell, second row
	
	Fourth cell, third row

[^fn1]:	 Like this one, presented **_before_** the table\.
	
	

[^fn2]:	 Like this one, presented **_after_** the table\.
